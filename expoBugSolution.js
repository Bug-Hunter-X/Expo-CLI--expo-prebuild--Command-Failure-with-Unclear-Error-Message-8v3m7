After extensive troubleshooting, the problem was resolved by creating a new Expo project from scratch.  While it did not pinpoint the root cause of the initial error, it suggests a potential issue within the original project's configuration or dependency tree that could not be easily identified. The solution serves as a workaround: if `expo prebuild` fails inexplicably, creating a new project and migrating code can resolve the issue. This indicates a potential bug in Expo CLI's error handling or a need for improved diagnostics to help users pinpoint underlying configuration problems.  Further investigation may involve comparing the configurations and dependency versions between the original and new projects to determine the source of the conflict.
