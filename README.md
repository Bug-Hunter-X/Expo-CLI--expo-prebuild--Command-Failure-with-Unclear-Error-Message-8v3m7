This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command. The command unexpectedly fails without providing a clear error message, obstructing the standard workflow of building and deploying Expo projects.  The `expoBug.js` file shows a sample project setup where the issue occurred. The solution, outlined in `expoBugSolution.js`, details the workaround used to overcome this problem.  Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact conditions leading to this failure and to request an improvement in error reporting from the Expo team.
